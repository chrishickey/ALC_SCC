## All Labels Combination  + Strongly Connected Component Approach for slving Label Constrained Reachability Queries
Python implementation of ALC SCC  method for solving Label constrained reachability queries

For a demo of the algorithm run
```python
python alc_end_end.py <graph_file (optional)>
```
If no graph file is specified the graph.txt file will be used instead

## Presentation
Please refer to presentation in docs folder for info on the proposed method
